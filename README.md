# What is it

This is a template repository that has the suggested directory structure and minimal boilerplate for generic cards.

# How to use it

 Select this template from the dropdown when creating a brand new generic card, that is not based on any other similar content:
<img width="911" height="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a66c88-4604-4db6-89e1-3d525eb73451" />
